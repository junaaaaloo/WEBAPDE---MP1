About "niche."
  The site "niche." was created in accordance to the specifications of the first Machine Problem for WEBAPDE. The main task of the Machine Problem was for the group to create a client-side applications that loads data from a JSON server (through the site https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) using AJAX (Asynchronous Java and XML). Using the site, the group was tasked to retrieve the posts, photos, albums, and user details that were in JSON format, and use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the application.
  
The site name
  The word "niche", as defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary, means "a place, employment, status, or activity for which a person or thing is best fitted".
  
  The group aptly named the site "niche.", as we feel the site creates a platform for its users to feel a sense of belongingness when using it, with them being able to express themselves amongst other users who are as free and liberated to express their thoughts, just like in a habitat.
  
Site Walkthrough
  Home/Posts Page
    When the site is opened, the client is shown the most recent posts made by the users. A post contains the title of the post, the name and username of the author of the post, and the content post. Clicking either the name or the username of the author will redirect the client to the user's profile. The client may opt to check more posts by pressing the "VIEW MORE" button at the bottom of the site. The client may also filter the posts through the search function right above the posts. The client is also given the option to view the other tabs from the navigation bar positioned at the top of the site.
    
  Images Page
    The images page of the site obviously shows the images posted by the users. Thumbnails of the most recent images posted by the users are shown and when hovered, provides the image caption. There is also a "VIEW MORE" button available. When the photo thumbnail is clicked, the full-sized image is viewed and details regarding the image's caption, along with the album it belongs in, and the owner's name and username are shown when hovered on. Clients are also able to filter the images by their caption. 
    
  Albums Page  
    In the albums tab, the client is shown the albums by their names and 4 random photo thumbnails belonging to the album. When the album is clicked, the client is redirected to the album page where the name of the album and the owner's name and username are displayed, along with the rest of the photos of the album. The client has the option to play a slideshow, or view a photo from the album in fullscreen.
    
  Users Page  
    Finally, the users tab of the site would display all the users of the site, with their own respective names and usernames. Clicking a user would redirect the client to the user's profile page.
    
  User Profile Page
    The profile page of a user displays various information regarding the user. Information such as their name, username, e-mail address, phone number, website, company details, and even their own address displayed on a map are displayed on the profile. Clients viewing the user profile are also shown snippets of the user's recent posts, with the option to read the entire post, and the user's albums.
